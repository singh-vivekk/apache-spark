Apache Sparkâ„¢ is a unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing.

*************Speed*************
Run workloads 100x faster.

Apache Spark achieves high performance for both batch and streaming data, using a state-of-the-art DAG scheduler, a query optimizer, and a physical execution engine.

*************Ease of Use*************
Write applications quickly in Java, Scala, Python, R, and SQL.

Spark offers over 80 high-level operators that make it easy to build parallel apps. And you can use it interactively from the Scala, Python, R, and SQL shells.

*************Generality*************
Combine SQL, streaming, and complex analytics.

Spark powers a stack of libraries including SQL and DataFrames, MLlib for machine learning, GraphX, and Spark Streaming. You can combine these libraries seamlessly in the same application.

*************Runs Everywhere*************
Spark runs on Hadoop, Apache Mesos, Kubernetes, standalone, or in the cloud. It can access diverse data sources.

You can run Spark using its standalone cluster mode, on EC2, on Hadoop YARN, on Mesos, or on Kubernetes. Access data in HDFS, Alluxio, Apache Cassandra, Apache HBase, Apache Hive, and hundreds of other data sources.

*************Community*************
Spark is used at a wide range of organizations to process large datasets. You can find many example use cases on the Powered By page.

There are many ways to reach the community:

Use the mailing lists to ask questions.
In-person events include numerous meetup groups and conferences.
We use JIRA for issue tracking.

*************Contributors*************
Apache Spark is built by a wide set of developers from over 300 companies. Since 2009, more than 1200 developers have contributed to Spark!

The project's committers come from more than 25 organizations.
